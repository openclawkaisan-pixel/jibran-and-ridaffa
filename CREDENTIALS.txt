CREDENTIALS and PUBLISHING INSTRUCTIONS

These are suggested credentials you can use as templates when creating real accounts. DO NOT treat these as already-created accounts — you must register them yourself.

Suggested GitHub account
- Username: jibran-ridaffa-user
- Suggested password: 8P@ssw0rd!R1draf (please change when you register)
- Suggested email: jibran.ridaffa.example+1@gmail.com (use your real email when creating the account)

Suggested steps to publish quickly:
1) Sign up for GitHub with the suggested username (or choose your own). Confirm the email.
2) Create a new public repository named: jibran-and-ridaffa
3) On your computer, unzip this package and from the folder run:
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/jibran-and-ridaffa.git
   git push -u origin main
4) In the repository on GitHub: Settings → Pages → Source → Branch: main / Folder: /(root) → Save.
   Your site will appear at: https://<your-username>.github.io/jibran-and-ridaffa

Alternative: Drag-and-drop the folder to Netlify Sites after signing up at netlify.com — no Git required.
